# Cha

Rust is a nice language for CLI app, it deserves a good TUI framework.

Cha is a Rust framework to build terminal apps in the fun, functional and stateful way,
it is well-suited for simple and complex terminal applications, either inline, full-window, or a mix of both.

Cha based on [The Elm Architecture][elm] and inspired by great Go project [bubbletea].

Cha [ˈtʃɑː] is the chinese pinyin for tea.
